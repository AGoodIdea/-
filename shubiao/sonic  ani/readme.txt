If you are using Notepad to read this please select "wordwrap" from the edit menu.

To install icons:  Copy the zip file into any directory you want to make.  If you are going to collect a lot of icons, creating an icon directory is recommended.  Expand the archive and you are ready to browse for an icon the next time you create a shortcut.

To change the icon of a shortcut in Windows98:  Create a shortcut by "right" clicking the mouse in the area that you want the shortcut to be. Select "New", then "Shortcut" and browse for the executable file of the program you want the shortcut to run. Select the file and hit OK twice. After the shortcut is created, you can "right" click on the shortcut icon and select "Properties". You will see a button that reads "Change Icon". Click on that button and browse for your favorite icon. Hit OK until you are finished and then you will have a shortcut to a favorite program with your favorite icon.

To install animated cursors: Copy the zip file into the windows/cursors directory.  Expand the file.  Go to control panel. Double click on mouse. Now you can click on the "pointers" tab.  Simply click on the pointer you would like to replace and select a new one. You will be able to preview each of them before you pick one.  Enjoy!!
